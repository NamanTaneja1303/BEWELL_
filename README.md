# BEWELL_
Be-Well is a mental Health Analysis program which detects your state of mind and provides you with suggestions and comforting words. 
There is an AI ChatBot which the user can talk to and share whatever is in their mind. The bot will analyse the user’s mood and reply with suitable things to say. It is like a digital friend which the user can carry anywhere and talk to whenever they feel lonely and depressed. 
There’s also a voice recognition software and a sentiment analysis software that detect the user’s mood from their voice and the chat input. 
If the app detects high possibility of the user being in a state of depression or Anxiety disorder, it will suggest the user to see a professional psychologist. 
Once completed, with a nice GUI, it will be a wholesome application which  will help the user in maintaining their mental wellbeing, hence the name Be-Well.
